    "text": "With the increase in the number of patients affected by COVID-19 and admitted to Intensive Care Units throughout the world, the demand for the medicines necessary for their treatment has increased. Laboratories have increased production. However, Drug Agencies worldwide confirm that there are problems related to the supply of some specific medicines.\\nFor years, a large amount of scientific literature about coronavirus (currently, more than 60,000 scientific papers) has been generated. This is a great help for eveybody fighting against COVID-19, but at the same time such a large corpus is difficult to explore. Furthermore, the same active ingredient may be found in more than one trade name, what makes exploration of this corpus even more difficult for those who have to make quick informed decisions related to medicine use and supplies."

Furthermore, the mention of a medicine in a scientific paper may inform about its possible use, but sometimes it may be also inside a sentence or paragraph that has no relevance to our objective of saving lives."
